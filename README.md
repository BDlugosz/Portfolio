# About Me
Firts I heard about software testing from my friend, who end up working as tester but I had a job and didn't knew I will change it :)

After few month I decided I want to join IT family and started looking aroud what would be great for me.
First I decided to look at computer network, because I was styding it. But it wasn't for me :)
Then I remebered about testing and that's was it! :D
I knew my personality will fit into it :)
